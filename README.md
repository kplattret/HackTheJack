# Hack The Jack

The source code for [hackthejack.uk](http://hackthejack.uk)

A project by Peter Jones, who I helped with the code. This was made as part of the [Hack The Space hackathon](http://hackthespace.3-beards.com).

## What is this about?

The concept comprises a hacked Union Jack flag that initially asks the question "Ain't no blue in the Union Jack?" and will gradually reveal its true meaning as the Scottish Independence Referendum vote approaches on 18 September 2014.

The fully revealed hacked flag shows that there is indeed blue (and black) in the Union Jack. These colours represent the battering and bruising nature of much of the data being created on social media concerning the referendum - the flag is literally "black and blue" when fully revealed by the time of the vote.

## Data source(s) used

Tweets showing the divisive nature of some data being created on social media will be incorporated to support the evolution of the hacked flag - an [example tweet](https://twitter.com/DignityProject/status/476684436676034560) referring to J.K. Rowling from @DignityProject is: "What a #bitch after we gave her shelter in our city when she was a single mum. http://fb.me/17RMtBZ0l".

The above tweet has been identified and retweeted by the @HackTheJack account. Most of the data supporting this project will be generated on social media as the referendum vote approaches, and will be similarly identified, retweeted and incorporated into the HackTheJack project.
